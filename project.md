## Project Overview

NEUROLOV is a gamified mobile application that engages users through a tapping mechanism, rewarding them with compute power and experience points (XP). Users can upgrade their virtual GPUs, complete quests, earn achievements, and compete on leaderboards.

## Feature List

1. User Authentication via Telegram
2. GPU Tapping Mechanism
   - Compute Power Generation
   - XP Accumulation
3. GPU Upgrade System
4. Daily Check-in Rewards
5. Quest System
   - Daily Quests
   - Achievements
6. Leaderboard System
   - Daily, Weekly, and All-time Rankings
7. Referral System
8. User Settings
   - Notifications
   - Language Preferences
   - Theme Selection

## User Journey

1. User starts by clicking the START bot command in Telegram to launch the microapp.
2. Upon first launch, user is greeted with a welcome screen offering a one-time XP bonus.
3. After claiming the bonus, user is directed to the main app screen featuring the GPU fan.
4. User taps the GPU fan to generate compute and earn XP.
5. As user accumulates compute, they can upgrade their GPU to increase compute generation rate.
6. Daily quests and achievements provide additional XP and engagement opportunities.
7. User can check their ranking on various leaderboards.
8. Referral system allows users to invite friends and earn bonuses.
9. Settings page allows customization of app experience.

## Integration Guide

1. Set up Telegram Bot:
   - Create a bot via BotFather on Telegram
   - Note down the bot token

2. Frontend Integration:
   - Use Telegram WebApp SDK for authentication
   - Implement API calls using fetch or axios
   - Handle JWT token storage and inclusion in request headers

3. Error Handling:
   - Implement proper error handling for all API calls
   - Display user-friendly error messages

4. Real-time Updates:
   - Use WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for real-time updates (e.g., leaderboard changes)

## Deployment Guide

1. Prerequisites:
   - AWS account
   - MongoDB Atlas account
   - GitHub account
   - Vercel account (for frontend deployment)

2. Backend Deployment (AWS Elastic Beanstalk):
   - Create Elastic Beanstalk application
   - Set up environment variables
   - Configure database connection
   - Set up SSL certificate

3. Database Setup:
   - Create MongoDB Atlas cluster
   - Set up database user and connection string
   - Configure network access

4. Frontend Deployment (Vercel):
   - Connect GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Configure build settings
   - Set up environment variables

5. DNS Configuration:
   - Set up custom domain in AWS Route 53
   - Configure DNS records for backend and frontend

6. CI/CD Setup:
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Testing Guide

1. Unit Testing:
   - Use Jest for unit tests
   - Cover all utility functions and models

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test API endpoints using Supertest
   - Ensure proper database interactions

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Use Cypress for frontend E2E tests
   - Cover critical user journeys

4. Performance Testing:
   - Use Apache JMeter for load testing
   - Simulate high concurrency scenarios

5. Security Testing:
   - Perform regular security audits
