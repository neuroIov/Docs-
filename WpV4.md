## 8. GPU Allocation and Management

Neurolov's GPU allocation and management system is designed to optimize resource utilization, ensure fair distribution, and maximize performance for all users.

### 8.1 Resource Allocation Algorithm

The core of Neurolov's GPU management is a sophisticated allocation algorithm:

#### 8.1.1 Multi-factor Scoring System

Each GPU request is scored based on multiple factors:

```python
Score = (User_Stake * 0.4) + (Task_Urgency * 0.3) + (Task_Complexity * 0.3)
```

- **User_Stake**: Determined by the amount of $NLOV tokens staked
- **Task_Urgency**: Calculated based on user-defined priorities and deadlines
- **Task_Complexity**: Estimated using heuristics like model size, dataset volume, and computational intensity

#### 8.1.2 Dynamic Pricing Model

GPU pricing adjusts in real-time based on supply and demand:

```python
Price = BasePrice * (1 + DemandFactor) * (1 + CapabilityFactor) * SeasonalAdjustment
```

- **BasePrice**: Set by GPU providers
- **DemandFactor**: Increases during high-demand periods
- **CapabilityFactor**: Adjusts based on GPU specifications
- **SeasonalAdjustment**: Accounts for long-term usage patterns

## 9. Performance and Scalability

Neurolov is designed to deliver high performance and seamless scalability as the network grows.

### 9.1 Distributed GPU Performance Model

The platform uses a sophisticated model to predict and optimize performance:

```python
P = (N * G * E) / (1 + L/C)

Where:
P = Overall performance
N = Number of GPUs
G = Individual GPU performance
E = Parallelization efficiency
L = Network latency
C = Computation time
```

This model helps in predicting performance gains and optimizing resource allocation.

- **Kernel Fusion**: Combines multiple small operations into larger, more efficient kernels

### 9.5 Proof of Computation (PoC)

Neurolov implements a robust PoC system:

1. **Task Commitment**: GPU providers stake $NLOV tokens as a guarantee
2. **Execution**: The task is performed on the GPU
3. **Result Submission**: Providers submit results with a zero-knowledge proof
4. **Verification**: Multiple nodes verify the proof using a fraction of the original computation
5. **Consensus**: Results are accepted if a majority of verifiers agree
